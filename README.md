- Maybe try and achieve a full screen visualizer, similar to what DaLarm and I were initially motivated to make this into
- Introduce typescript for better type checking/hinting?
- Incorporate tailwind.css
- Get rid of bootstrap
- Keep fontawesome? Use another icon set?
- Bring in tailwind.css?
- Will need to look for some inspiration to figure out LoE of styling
